# this tools is currently still a work in progress
> as of 10th June 2024, this tool is still in progress, but now features an example of how to run two stubs generated by this tool (with or without monitors) under `/sample_project/`.

> as of 8th June 2024 this tool is being developed/finished ASAP. this README will be updated to say when it is finished.

## 0. updates

```erl
gen_stub:gen(ali,spec,default,"_ali_test.erl").
```

### todo

- update readme properly
- improve `sample_app` directory tutorial/example
- add sample `configuration presets` for monitors (verify only, enforce light, enforce strong) - (currently, these have to be configured manually over several options. adding presets would essentially bundle sets of options together.)
- update monitors with functionality developed recently, and clear up the file
- clean up repo (alot of remnants from the original project still exist that are no longer relevant.)


## 1. Getting started guide

This is a tool for composing protocols, generating state machines based on
protocol specification, and extracting protocols from existing code.

The protocol type is defined within interleave.erl. This file also contains a few
examples together with the algorithm for protocol composition.

### Prerequisites

The following software needs to be installed:

- Erlang: Erlang/OTP 24 Erts 12.2.1
- rebar3: rebar 3.17.0

### Building

The tool can be built using rebar3:

    rebar3 compile

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Running

Enter the rebar3 shell:

  rebar3 shell
Protocol Composition:
Strong:

  interleave:interleave(Protocol1, Protocol2).

Weak:

    interleave:interleaveWeak(Protocol1, Protocol2).

Correlating:

  interleave:interleaveCorrelating(Protocol1, Protocol2).

All:

  interleave:interleaveAll(Protocol1, Protocol2).

For example:

    interleave:interleaveWeak(examples:pin(), examples:tan()).

Code Generation:

    generate:gen(Protocol, FileName).

For example:

    generate:gen(examples:pin(),"pin.erl").

Protocol Extraction:

    extract:protocol(FileName).

For example:

    extract:protocol("pin.erl").

To obtain Table 1 from the paper run:

  examples:table().

## 2. Overview of the claims

Claims supported by the artifact:

 1. Protocol Composition: Strong, Weak, Correlating, All
 2. Protocol Generation
 3. Protocol Extraction

Results presented in Table 1 should be obtained on any machine.
To obtain Table 1 from the paper run:

  examples:table().
